## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package, distribute, and run applications in containers. Containers allow you to package all the dependencies of an application into a single unit, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with Docker, you'll need to install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine on your machine. You can find installation instructions and guides on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once Docker is installed, you can start by running your first container using the `docker run` command. For example:

```bash
docker run hello-docker
